#Goals for the project is to write a code block that can be integrated into the Genesys kineticsgui.py program to create graphs based on csv files created by another program in the repository using matplotlib


#this is what I have thus far concluded about integrating
#matplotlib and the beginnings of how to graph some data
#both matplotlib, pandas and scipy are required
from matplotlib import pyplot as plt 
#from scipy.stats import linregress
#from matplotlib.backends.backend_tkagg import FigureCanvasTkAgg #not utilized yet but will likely be necessary later
#from matplotlib.figure import Figure #also for later improvements
import pandas #makes reading csv easier than importing csv

x=[] #establishes the x variable as an empty list 
y=[] #establishes the y variable as an empty list 
colnames = ['Reaction','Substrate','Vol','Time','Abs']
data = pandas.read_csv('reverse.csv', names=colnames) #need to figure out how to allow csv name to be input by user
time = data.Time.tolist() #adds the values from the csv file that corresponds to the time column to a list
Abs = data.Abs.tolist() #adds the values from the csv file that corresponds to the absorbance column to a list
x, y = (time, Abs) #sets values from the time column as the x list, and the values from the Abs column as the y list
plt.plot(x,y, marker='o') #plots the x and y values and sets a marker for each coordinate point
plt.title('Absorbance over Time') #as the absorbance readings from the spectrophotometer are recorded with a time stamp
plt.xlabel('Time of Reading') #label for the x axis
plt.ylabel('Sample Absorbance') #label for the y axis
plt.show() #displays the plot built in previous lines
